## Overview 
This project presents a Multi-Agent Research Assistant System designed to automate key research tasks, such as literature review, data analysis, and report writing. The system uses specialized agents for PDF parsing, literature search, summarization, knowledge management, analysis, citation generation, and report writing. A central Orchestrator Agent detects the input type (text query or PDF) and delegates tasks to the appropriate agents, streamlining the research process. By automating repetitive tasks, the system enhances efficiency, ensures consistency, and reduces manual workload, ultimately supporting more productive and accurate research. This framework showcases the potential of multi-agent systems to improve academic and industry research workflows.

## Key Frameworks Used in AcademicMAS
1. **SPADE**: A framework for developing multi-agent systems, providing tools for managing and communicating between agents.
2. **Langchain**: Facilitates the integration of large language models (LLMs) into workflows for natural language tasks.
3. **Langraph**: A library for visualizing interactions and relationships in large-scale agent-based systems.
4. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enhances language models by integrating them with external knowledge retrieval systems to improve output relevance.
